		<h2>What We Build</h2>
		<img src="images/p2.jpg" alt="good nutrition" class="desktop">
		
		<h2> ENDURANCE</h2>
		<p> Burns fat, strengthens the heart and lungs, and is a great natural stress reliever for dogs. </p> 
		<h2>STRENGTH</h2>
		<p> Stimulates muscle growth, increases bone density, and strengthens connective tissues that can help prevent injuries. </p> 
		<h2>BALANCE</h2>
		<p> Builds better body awareness in dogs and takes stress off the weaker limbs to maximize proper posture and development. </p>
		<h2>FLEXIBILITY</h2>
		<p> Promotes better range of motion, better circulation, and more oxygen to the muscles. </p>
	    <h2>MENTAL</h2>
		<p> Mental training builds cognitive abilities and beats boredom and destructive behavior. </p> 
		<h2>BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE</h2>
		<p> Because a fit dog is a happy, healthy, calm, and disciplined dog! </p>

		<p>Don’t want to sort through all the individual exercises? Well, we have a solution for that! </p>

		   We have shorter workouts that only take minutes to do and can exhaust your dog for the rest of the day!</p>
