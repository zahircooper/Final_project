		<h1>Cardio</h1>
		<img class="equip" src="images/p6.jpg" alt="Cardio- doggy" height="150" width="360">
		<p>Dogs have a high degree of stamina compared to humans.</p> 
           
            <p>Wild wolves spend many days traveling through mountains
            and forests in search of food.</p>
            
           <p> Domestic dogs have retained many of these traits which
            enable them to sustain running and walking over long
            periods of time.</p>
            
            <p> A long body on four legs enables it to keep a steady rate of
            movement without exhausting its reserves of energy.</p>
            
            <p> A dog can also regulate its core temperature during
            intense exercise by panting and raising or lowering its fur.</p>

		<h1>Core & Stretching</h1>
		<img class="equip" src="images/p4.jpeg" alt="Core" height="250" width="250"><img class="equip" src="images/p5.jpeg" alt="Core" height="250" width="250">
		<p>When
            your dog has a strong core and in good shape, the entire
            body is better supported. This also means less stress on
            the joints and better balance when working or playing.
            There's less chance of injury when your dog builds a
            stronger core.</p>

            <p>
                Stretching is a
                    great way to build better flexibility, mobility and help
                        prevent future injuries.

			<h1>Common Exercises</h1>
			<p>The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to do as part of their daily exercise routine.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Staircases</dt>
				<dd>The steps add an additional challenge to a dog's workout,
                    as they engage different muscles than those used on.
                    regular walk or run and add an extra level of difficulty with
                    the change in elevation.</dd>
			
				<dt>WalkBacks</dt>
				<dd>Walking backwards takes a lot of focus and coordination
                    for dogs.
                    This maneuver improves rear leg strength and
                    proprioception.</dd>
			
				<dt>WaterWalks</dt>
				<dd>Aquatic therapy an help to improve your pup's strength,
                    range of motion and endurance. The buoyancy properties
                    of water minimize weight bearing stress to the joints, which
                    helps prevent tissue injuries, inflammation and pain.	</dd>
